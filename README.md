# Tiktok Username Checker (proxyless) - by mdevio

Simple script for checking the availability of tiktok usernames and generating usernames, made in Python 3.12

This script can be useful if you want to obtain a username with as few characters in it as possible.

# Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# Installation:

You can skip step 1 & 2 by typing the command `git clone https://github.com/mdevio/tiktok-username-checker.git` into your command prompt (in the directory where you want it installed). Note: You need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed for this.

1. Install the latest version as a zip-archive with all the files here: [Tiktok Username Checker](https://github.com/mdevio/tiktok-username-checker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. Extract the zip-file and store the contents somewhere on your drive. To do this I would recommend using either [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html).

3. Open up the command prompt on your windows machine and copy the path to the installation. (Hold down shift & right click on the folder, then press "Copy as path".)

4. Run the following command: `cd PATH_YOU_COPIED` into the command prompt.

5. Run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This command will install the necessary packages which are needed for the program to run without issues.

6. Start the program by writing `python main.py` or by simply double clicking the python file.
